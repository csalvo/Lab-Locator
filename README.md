# Lab-Locator

Built for hospitals that require patients to complete follow-up lab work preferrably in the same hospital system. Lab Locator enables these patients to locate and get directions to the lab closest to their chosen location. It also allows hospital staff to maintain their list of preferred in-network labs in one centralized location.  

## Built With
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Database
* [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) - Used to find distances of labs to user location and to render the maps
* [Flowtype.js](http://simplefocus.com/flowtype/) - Used to make the search page & search results mobile responsive
* [Defiant.js](http://defiantjs.com/) - Used for the search feature on the Lab Admin page
